Syntax of the operators according to precedence order:
* Atoms are any combination of lowercase letters and digits, except the 'v', which is used for disjunction
* Negation is the dash '-'
* Conjunction is the ampersand '&'
* Disjunction is the letter 'v'
* Implication is the dash followed by the grater than symbol '->'
Precedence is the same that the above order. All operators are interpreted as right-associative.
